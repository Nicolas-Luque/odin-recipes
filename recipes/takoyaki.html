        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Takoyaki is a popular Japanese street food that features savory octopus-filled dough balls, cooked until crispy on the outside 
            and soft on the inside. These bite-sized treats are a delightful blend of textures and flavors, often enjoyed with toppings like 
            takoyaki sauce, mayonnaise, bonito flakes, and seaweed.
        </p>

            Originating in Osaka, takoyaki has become a beloved snack across Japan and is a must-try for anyone exploring Japanese cuisine.
            With its charming round shape and unique taste, it's no wonder that takoyaki stands are a common sight at festivals and food markets.
